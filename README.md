1 - How to run the game
Running the game is easy!   You can either:

Clone this repo to your desktop and run index.hml in your browser (only chrome has been tested locally) or...

You can go to http://www.gamisweb.com/frogger and play to your hearts content


2 - Playing the game

Objective: 
Reach the water without getting hit by the bugs and get the highest score you can.
Each time you reach the water, you will score points, advance a level and be returned to the
start, but the enemies will move faster with each level. If you hit an enemy, you will be reset
to the beginning and lose all your points.

Controls: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (sorry, no mobile support yet)

Have fun!
